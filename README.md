## Git repository
For this work, we worked in a repository, which you can find here: _https://github.com/FiammaV/ic_2018_p1_



## Our solution

We made a roulette game in which we used a _switch case_ to register all the possible options the player can give, and a separate file in which we stored all functions necessary for all cases, inside a _while_, to keep the game running until the player decided to quit, by choosing the option _'c'_. We used _if_'s and _else_'s for our verification methods, a lot of imagination to make it fun for the player. ;)


## Conclusions

 - Inês - With this project, I have now a better understanding in how switch cases work, and how to re-arrange the code so it's easier to read and understand.
 Like Sara, I too had fun working on this, especially when making sure the player enjoyed the little interactions from the console.

 - Sara - While making code beyond being happy, I went nuts, but I actually understand a little bit of the logic on how to make a program work in C and how to call a function from another file. It was fun.
